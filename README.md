Password-based Key Derivation
=============================

This web page with associated JavaScript allows a user to
enter a password and derive a key for symmetric
encryption from it.

This example is provided to illustrate how to use the W3C
[Web Cryptography API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/ "API Draft")
to perform password based key derivation. It is based on the
[candidate recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-WebCryptoAPI-20141211/
"Dated Recommendation") of the standard available when this example was
created.

Using this example requires a web browser that implements a compatible version
of the Web Cryptography API and the
[Encoding API](http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding/).
When the example was created, current versions of Google Chrome,
Firefox, and Opera browsers could run the example.

**This is not intended to be a production tool.** Rather, it may
be helpful to developers who intend to create their own tools using
the Web Cryptography API.
